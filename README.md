- **Habit Customization**: Edit the six habits easily whenever you want.
- **Automatic Monthly Reset**: Automatically resets and backs up your habit data when a new month starts.
- **Manual Reset Option**: Manually export and reset your data anytime.

## How It Works

---

### 1. Changing Habits

Customize your six habits by selecting **Change Habits**.  
You will be prompted to enter **six habit names separated by commas**.

Example input:
```
Sleep, Training, Cardio, Water, Reading, Meditation
```

After saving, your widget will immediately display the new habits.

### 2. Resetting the Month

There are **two ways** the month can be reset:

- **Automatic Reset**:  
  At the start of a new month, the widget automatically:
  - Exports a summary of your previous month's habit performance to the clipboard,
  - Resets the tracker for the new month.

You do **not need to manually reset** this happens automatically.

- **Manual Reset**:  
  If you want to reset before the month ends, select **Reset Month** inside the app:
  - It will export the current month's data to the clipboard,
  - Then reset your tracker manually.

### 4. Tracking Habits (Check-in)

You can mark a habit for today inside the Scriptable app by selecting **Check-in**.  
Each habit row shows daily progress with small dots:
- **Filled dot** = Habit completed.
- **Unfilled dot** = Habit not completed.
